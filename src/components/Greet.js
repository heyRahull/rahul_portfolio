            <br />
            I am a Self-taught programmer, Computer Science graduate, reader,
            and a thinker. I have completed my Bachelor's and graduated in 2021.
            I am passionate about computers from a young age and always excited
            about the impact of products of technology can have on customers.
            <br />
            <br />I am really interested into exploring the world of
            web-technology and I have done some projects from the perspective of
            figuring things out myself by tinkering different parts of projects.
            I am open to all kinds of opportunities that involve growth.
